## 📌 Project Overview
SolarAI is a next-generation energy management dashboard designed for smart solar farms. It integrates real-time environmental data, physics-based simulations, and intelligent energy routing algorithms into a "Cyber-Glass" aesthetic interface.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 🌍 Autonomous Environmental Simulation
- **Real-Time Physics:** Uses `framer-motion` to simulate panel tilt, dust accumulation, and cleaning drone operations.
- **Weather Integration:** Fetches live weather data to adjust solar efficiency calculations dynamically.
- **Algorithm:** Monitors standard parameters ($P_{solar} = I \times A \times \eta$) to determine energy flow.

### 2. ⚡ Intelligent Energy Routing
- **Logic Core:** Automatically switches between **Solar**, **Battery**, and **Grid** based on real-time load demand and battery SOC.
- **EV Charging:** managing load balancing for connected electric vehicle stations.

### 3. 🔐 Enterprise-Grade Authentication
- **Secure Access:** Dashboard is protected by JWT-based authentication.
- **Persistence:** User sessions are saved locally (`localStorage`).
- **Demo Mode:** built-in fallback allows the UI to function seamlessly even without a backend connection.

### 4. 📊 Advanced Analytics
- **Interactive Charts:** Visualizes battery cycles, cleaning intervals, and solar irradiance.
- **Reporting:** Generates and downloads CSV reports for system performance.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React (Vite), Framer Motion, Recharts, Lucide React
- **Styling:** CSS3 Variables, Glassmorphism, Responsive Grid
- **Deployment:** Vercel (Production)
